## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to voters in historically landslide counties or states. More specifically, the data surrounding those registered to parties other than the dominant regional party, and the statistics surrounding voter turnout, third party vote share, and an evaluation of change over time. This can be broken up deeper into demographic categories like gender, education, ethnicities, and more.
